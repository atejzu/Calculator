# Calculator

This repository contains a simple desktop calculator application created with **Java Swing**. The project was originally generated using NetBeans and includes the autogenerated form files.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Toggle buttons to enable or disable the calculator
- Positive/negative toggle, decimal input, and backspace
- GUI built with Swing components

## Project Structure

```
.
├── build.xml        # Ant build script
├── manifest.mf      # Manifest used when building a JAR
├── nbproject/       # NetBeans project configuration
└── src/Calculator/  # Java source code and NetBeans form file
```

The main class is `Calculator.Calculator`, located in `src/Calculator/Calculator.java`.

## Building

If you have [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) installed, you can build the project using the included `build.xml`:

```bash
ant jar
```

This will compile the sources and create a runnable JAR in the `dist` directory. You can then run the application with:

```bash
java -jar dist/Calculator_atejzu.jar
```

Alternatively, you may open the project in NetBeans and use the IDE's *Build* and *Run* commands.

## Running

After building, run the generated JAR file. A windowed calculator interface should appear, allowing you to perform standard arithmetic operations.

## License

This project does not currently include a license file. If you intend to distribute or modify it, consider adding an appropriate open-source license.
